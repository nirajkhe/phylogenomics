This code can be used for phylogenomics analysis of organism based on kegg orthology database.
Code use the percentage of co-occured orthologs to find simlarity between organisms. Here input file is binary matrix of rows as orthologs and columns as organisms.
We can use different distance measure for phylogenomics profile generation like Jaccard index, dollo distance, pearson correlation coefficient.
